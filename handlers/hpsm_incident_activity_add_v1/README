=== Detailed Description
This handler makes a SOAP call (using Savon) to the HP Service Manager Web 
Services to add an activity update to a new HPSM Incident. After Savon is 
configured with your HPSM server, a hash is made containing the incident id and
the activity update that you wish to send. That hash is then converted into an 
XML string and sent to HPSM to update the incident. Any messages that were 
caused by the request and the id of the updated incident will be returned by the 
handler upon success. If there are any errors, the handler will raise an 
exception which will contain any messages that HPSM returned about the error.
