=== Detailed Description
This handler makes a SOAP call (using Savon) to the HP Service Manager Web 
Services to update an existing HPSM Incident. After Savon is configured with 
your HPSM server, a hash is made containing all of the information that was 
inputted to update on the incident. That hash is then converted into an XML 
string and sent to HPSM to update the incident. Any messages that were caused by 
the request and the id of the incident that was updated will be returned by the 
handler upon success. If there are any errors, the handler will raise an 
exception which will contain any messages that HPSM returned about the error.
