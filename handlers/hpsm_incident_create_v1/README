=== Detailed Description
This handler makes a SOAP call (using Savon) to the HP Service Manager Web 
Services to create a new HPSM Incident. After Savon is configured with your
HPSM server, a hash is made containing all of the information that was inputted
to create an incident. That hash is then converted into an XML string and sent
to HPSM to create the incident. Any messages that were caused by the request and
the id of the new incident will be returned by the handler upon success. If
there are any errors, the handler will raise an exception which will contain any
messages that HPSM returned about the error.
